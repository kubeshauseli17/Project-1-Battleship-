---- Battleship ------

---- Pitch -------

My pitch is simple a good old fashioned game of battleship. I'll have two seperate 10x10 grids 
where the player and computer will put their ships. Both sides will alternate turns till a victor 
 determined.

---- Tech being used --------

HTML
CSS
Javascript

---- MVP --------

Display game instructions and Buttons (Restart, Spin Ship)

Render 2 seperate 10x10 grids for the player and computer.

Render each players 5 ships (Patrol Boat, Submarine, Destroyer, Battleship, and Aircraft Carrier)

Let the player select their ships locations and orientation. Have computer randomly select its 
ships location and orientaion.
 agree agree agreed blocks. Mark hit ships with red blocks and track the
ships damage. Sunken ships are marked black. 

Track each players ships and determine winner when all opposing ships are sunk. Track player wins.

---- Stretch goals -------

Implement Battleboat Javascript AI for the computer.

---- Roadbloacks -------

Not certain, everything seems fairly doable.

---- Reflections ------

I definitely should've picked something easier. I couldn't figure out the logic issues with randomly placing computer ships and verifying they arent intersecting. I ran into numerous bugs at the end of this project that where tedious to resolve. Next project I need to do a better job of planning everything out and accounting for time debugging. I also need to do a better job of asking for help, limiting the scope of my MVP to something more realistically attainable, and add any non essential goals to stretch.
